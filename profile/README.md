## About USA for UNHCR

The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), also known as the UN Refugee Agency, is the world’s leading organization aiding and protecting people forced to flee their homes due to violence, conflict and persecution. UNHCR provides shelter, food, water, medical care and other lifesaving assistance to refugees around the world.

The dream of most refugees is to return home. When possible, UNHCR helps refugees return to their homeland. When refugees can’t go back home, UNHCR helps them rebuild their lives in another country. Since its formation by the United Nations General Assembly in 1950, UNHCR has helped an estimated 50 million refugees restart their lives and has twice received the Nobel Peace Prize.
